BY THE WAY, THE THUMBNAIL HAD MY NAME< DATE< AND THE TITLE OF MY PROJECT>>

So, i jsut realized i forgot to talk about making the graph part, but that was the hardest thing about my project--learning how to do it and I ran out of time to actually learn and practice it. However, i am happy that i got the main part done at least.
