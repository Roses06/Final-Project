Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have set up the main thing such as adding the income and expenses, and then seeing the remaining amount. I want to add more categories--so it is more organized. I am still not sure how I want to proceed wiht this, but i will figure it out.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

making the graph...it is actually a bit more different than I thought. Maybe I'll make the code with more things so it makes up for the graphing

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The graphing, figuring out how to actually use it and to set it up. it's much more diffcult than expected.
