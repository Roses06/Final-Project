# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

GraphiBucks

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An app or website that allow an indiviudual to visual and track their expenses.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

GraphiBucks is a budget tracking app that helps manage as well as visualize ones' expenses with ease. Users are able to input their income 
and any and all their costs--they can even catorize them to their liking. The core feature for this project is the graphs that will be 
displayed as time goes on. Users will be able to see this change in real-time, which makes this project resourceful and helps aid in making good 
financial decisions. This project will be built using python and some other things with the help of Professor Rosen and my brother.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will definitely complete the storing part and keeping track of the users inputs and their ongoing list of expenses.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think i might be able to touch on how to use graphs since we haven't exactly done thing with graphs. We did create grids but it's not te same as a graph.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Everything
- stored users inputs and ability to add or remove items from the list
- adding an option to view a graph if the user desires it
- making the graph actually function, showing the change in real-time and all their expenses / income / others.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I have learned how to store information and how to extend it, however I do not know how to do graphs nor how to add pictures or stuff like that. 
I will have to learn how to complete that as well as making sure it matches the data that is stored by the users
So far, that's it for now. Might be more to come.
